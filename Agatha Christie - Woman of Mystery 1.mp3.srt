1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,640
Chapter one.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,080
Why don't you write a story?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,680
Agatha, Mary, Clarissa Miller was board.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,680
It was a winter morning in 1988.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,120
And she was in bed because she was ill.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,360
I'm feeling much better today,
she said to her mother, Clara.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,200
I think I'll get up.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,400
You're still ill, said Clara.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,240
The doctor told you to stay in bed

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,680
and keep warm,
and that's what you're going to do.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,760
Agatha was 18 years old at this time,

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,200
but in those days, daughters had
to do what their mothers told them.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,720
But I'm bored.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,520
Well, do something then, said her mother,
read a book or write a story?

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,920
Yes.
Why don't you write a story?

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:17,960
Right, a story said Agatha, surprised,
yes, her mother said like Match.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,560
Madge was Agatha's sister,
she was 11 years older than Agatha

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,080
and sometimes wrote short stories
for magazines like Vanity Fair.

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,560
I don't think that I can write stories,
said Agatha.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,800
How do you know, said her mother,
you've never tried.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,680
And she went to find a pencil and paper.

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,680
Soon after, Agatha sat up in bed
and began to write a story.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,840
It was called House of Beauty.

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,840
A strange story about dreams.

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,760
It wasn't a very good story.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,920
She typed it on Maja's old typewriter
and sent it off to a magazine.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
But they sent it back with a letter.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,600
Thank you for sending us your story.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
We are afraid we cannot publish it.

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,240
You must try again, said her mother.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,600
Clara was always sure that her
daughters could do anything.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,880
So Agatha went on writing stories
and sending them out to magazines.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,720
But they all came back.

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,480
She was a little disappointed.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,440
I'll try writing a novel.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
She decided.

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,440
An idea came to her.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,080
She remembered seeing a beautiful young

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,760
girl in a hotel in Cairo when she
was visiting Egypt with Klara.

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,720
The girl was always with two men,
one on each side of her.

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,320
One day, Agatha heard someone say,

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,480
that girl will have to decide
between them some time.

43
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,440
It was all that Agatha needed for an idea,
and she began writing.

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,320
It was not a detective novel.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,240
It was the story of a young girl who lived

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,720
in Cairo and it was called
Snow upon the Desert.

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,280
It was really two long stories
put together to make a book.

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,120
When it was finished, Agatha sent
it to three or four publishers.

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,320
But they all sent it back.

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,160
Oh, dear, said Agatha.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,320
What shall I do now?

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,880
Why don't you show it to Eden,
Phil Potts said Clara.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,160
Eden Filberts was a writer
who lived near the Miller's.

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,200
During his life, he wrote more than 100

55
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,800
popular novels and many
plays for the theater.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,040
Agatha was a little afraid of sending her

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,080
novel to this famous man,
but she agreed to do it and sent it off.

58
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,960
Mr.

59
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,640
Filberts was a good writer
and also a kind man.

60
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,360
He read Agatha's novel carefully
and wrote her a letter.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,200
Some of your writing is very good,

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,840
so I am sending you a letter
to take to my agent Hughes Massie.

63
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,760
Agatha, still only 18 years old,
went to London on the train.

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,320
It was a long journey
more than 200 miles from her home

65
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,440
in Torquay, in Devon, and the trains
were not so fast in those days.

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,320
She was very shy and Hughes Massey
was a big, frightening man.

67
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,920
Agatha gave him the letter
from Eden Filberts.

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Massie Redit talked with Agatha
for a while, then kept her book to read.

69
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,920
Agatha went home to wait.

70
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,600
Some months later, Marcy returned
snow upon the desert to her.

71
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,960
I do not think that I can find
a publisher for it, he wrote to her.

72
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,720
The best thing is to stop thinking about
it anymore and to write another book.

73
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,360
Agatha was disappointed.

74
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,080
She did write another book.

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,520
But some other important
things happened in her life.

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,120
First.
